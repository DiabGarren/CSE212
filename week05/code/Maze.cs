    /// and columns). The inner lists show what is in the maze:
    /// 
    /// 0 = Wall (You can't go through this)
    /// 1 = Open Path (You can go through this)
    /// 2 = End (You want to get to this point to win)

    /// See the Prove instructions for graphical representations of
    /// the 2 test mazes defined below.
    /// 
    /// The 'is_end_maze' and the 'is_valid_move' functions are
    /// already written for you.  These functions assume that the first
    /// square in the maze is (0,0).  These functions also assume
    /// that you can't leave the boundaries of the maze and that you 
    /// can't visit the same square in the same path (no circles).
    /// 
    /// The 'curr_path' variable is a list of (x,y) tuples that 
    /// represent the path we are currently on.  If you add a new position
    /// to the path, make sure that you add the tuple to the list so that the
    /// 'is_valid_move' function works properly.
    /// 
    /// The goal is to implement the 'solve_maze' function to display
    /// all paths to the end square using recursion.  When you find a path, 
    /// then displaying will be as simple as 'Print(curr_path)'.
